# EFKA API Integration

This skill provides comprehensive integration with the Greek Social Security organization (EFKA) through OpenClaw's file processing capabilities, enabling automated employee record management, contribution calculations, and compliance monitoring for Greek businesses.


## Setup

```bash
export OPENCLAW_DATA_DIR="/data"
export EFKA_USERNAME="your-efka-username"
export EFKA_PASSWORD="your-efka-password"
which jq curl || sudo apt install jq curl
```

EFKA credentials are required only for submitting social security declarations. Payroll calculations and contribution processing work offline. All government submissions require human approval (four-eyes workflow).


## Core Philosophy

- **OpenClaw Artifact Ready**: Designed specifically for upload and deployment to OpenClaw instances
- **File-Based Processing**: Robust file system approach suitable for production deployment
- **Greek Employment Law Compliance**: Complete adherence to Greek social security regulations
- **Payroll Integration**: Seamless connection with existing Greek payroll systems
- **Production Scalability**: Built to handle multiple clients and high transaction volumes
