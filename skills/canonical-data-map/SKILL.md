# Canonical Data Directory Map
## OpenClaw Greek Accounting System — v1.1

## Setup

This skill is a reference document — it defines the directory structure and naming conventions used by all other Greek accounting skills. No binaries or credentials required.

```bash
# Set the data directory (all skills read this)
export OPENCLAW_DATA_DIR="/data"

# Initialize the full directory structure
mkdir -p $OPENCLAW_DATA_DIR/{incoming/{invoices,receipts,statements,government},processing,clients,compliance/{vat,efka,mydata,e1,e3},banking/{imports/{alpha,nbg,eurobank,piraeus},processing,reconciliation},ocr/{incoming,output},reports,auth,system/{logs,process-locks},backups}
```

This document defines the complete file system architecture for the OpenClaw Greek Accounting system. It is the authoritative reference for all path decisions. No skill may introduce a new top-level directory or deviate from the naming conventions defined here without a version update to this document.

**v1.1 change:** Added `/data/memory/` — agent episodic memory, failure logs, pattern store, GitHub proposal queue, and rate-limit state. Owner: `memory-feedback` (Skill 19, Phase 4). All Phase 3B+ skills must include episode and failure log hooks that write into this tree.

## Root Structure

```
/data/
╔══ incoming/          # All raw input — documents arriving into the system
╔══ processing/        # Temporary working space — files mid-pipeline
╔══ clients/           # Canonical client records — the source of truth
╔══ compliance/        # Government filings and submissions
╔══ banking/           # Bank statement processing pipeline
╔══ ocr/               # OCR processing pipeline
╔══ efka/              # EFKA/social security processing pipeline
╔══ reports/           # Generated reports for human consumption
╔══ exports/           # Data exports leaving the system
╔══ imports/           # Bulk data imports entering the system
╔══ dashboard/         # Dashboard state, config, cache, history
╔══ auth/              # Authentication and access control
╔══ backups/           # Encrypted system backups
╔══ gdpr-exports/      # GDPR subject access request exports
╔══ memory/            # Agent episodic memory, failure logs, learning patterns, proposals
└══ system/            # System-level files: logs, schema versions, locks
```

---

## 1. `/data/incoming/` — Raw Input

All documents entering the system land here first, regardless of source (email attachment, manual drop, scanner, bank download). Nothing in `/data/incoming/` is processed yet.

```
/data/incoming/
╔══ invoices/          # Supplier invoices (PDF, image)
╔══ receipts/          # Receipts (PDF, image, phone photo)
╔══ statements/        # Bank statements (PDF, CSV, OFX)
╔══ government/        # AADE/EFKA notifications and documents
╔══ payroll/           # Hour sheets, employee documents
╔══ tax-documents/     # Tax certificates, employer statements (βεβαιώσεις)
╔══ contracts/         # Contracts and legal documents
└══ other/             # Uncategorised — routed after classification
```

**Naming convention for incoming files:**
Files dropped here may arrive with any name. The system must NOT rename them on arrival — the original filename is preserved for audit purposes. The system assigns a canonical name only when moving to `/data/processing/`.

---

## 2. `/data/processing/` — In-Flight Pipeline

Temporary working space. Files here are mid-pipeline and may be incomplete. No other skill should read from `/data/processing/` as a final source — always read from `/data/clients/` or `/data/compliance/` for canonical data.

```
/data/processing/
╔══ ocr/               # OCR in progress
╚   ╔══ queued/        # Waiting for OCR
╚   ╔══ enhanced/      # Image pre-processing complete
╚   ╔══ extracted/     # Text extracted, not yet validated
╚   └══ validated/     # OCR output validated, ready to route
╔══ classification/    # Document type identification in progress
╔══ reconciliation/    # Bank reconciliation working files
╚   ╔══ matching/      # Transaction matching in progress
╚   └══ flagged/       # Items needing human review
╔══ compliance/        # Filing preparation working files
╚   ╔══ vat/           # VAT return preparation
╚   ╔══ efka/          # EFKA declaration preparation
╚   └══ mydata/        # myDATA submission preparation
└══ imports/           # Bulk import validation in progress
```

**Cleanup policy:** Files in `/data/processing/` are deleted or archived after the pipeline completes successfully. They are never the canonical record.

---

## 3. `/data/clients/` — Client Master Records

The single source of truth for all client data. Every other skill that needs client information reads from here. Only the `client-data-management` skill writes to this tree.

```
/data/clients/
╔══ _index.json                    # Global client index (name, AFM, status, assignee)
╔══ _audit-log.json                # All access and change events across all clients
╔══ _schema-version.json           # Current schema version for migration tracking
└══ {AFM}/                         # One directory per client, keyed by AFM (e.g. EL123456789)
    ╔══ profile.json               # Master client record
    ╔══ identifiers.json           # AFM, GEMI, EFKA employer ID, IBANs
    ╔══ contacts.json              # Contact persons
    ╔══ notes.json                 # Relationship notes and meeting logs
    ╔══ compliance/
    ╚   ╔══ filings.json           # All completed filings (VAT, EFKA, E1, etc.)
    ╚   ╔══ obligations.json       # Recurring obligation schedule
    ╚   └══ gaps.json              # Missing/overdue filing log
    ╔══ documents/
    ╚   ╔══ registry.json          # Metadata index of all documents for this client
    ╚   ╔══ pending.json           # Documents awaiting processing or review
    ╚   └══ archive-index.json     # References to archived documents
    ╔══ correspondence/
    ╚   └══ {YYYYMMDD}_{type}_{draft-id}_sent.json  # Immutable sent communication records
    ╔══ comms-preferences.json     # Client-specific salutation, contact, language overrides
    ╔══ payroll/
    ╚   └══ {YYYY-MM}/             # One folder per pay period
    ╚       ╔══ hours-input.csv    # Raw hours data
    ╚       ╔══ calculations.json  # Computed payroll data
    ╚       └══ {employee-slug}_payslip.pdf   # Generated payslips
    ╔══ financial-statements/
    ╚   ╔══ index.json             # All generated statements, versions, periods, status
    ╚   ╔══ {YYYY-MM}_pl_v{N}.json               # P&L machine-readable
    ╚   ╔══ {YYYY-MM}_balance-sheet_v{N}.json     # Balance sheet machine-readable
    ╚   ╔══ {YYYY-MM}_cash-flow_v{N}.json         # Cash flow machine-readable
    ╚   └══ {YYYY-MM}_vat-summary_v{N}.json       # VAT summary machine-readable
    └══ gdpr/
        ╔══ consent.json           # Consent records
        ╔══ retention-policy.json  # Retention schedule for this client
        └══ deletion-log.json      # Record of any deletions performed
```

**AFM format:** Always `EL` + 9 digits, uppercase. Example: `EL123456789`. Never store without the `EL` prefix. Never use the 9-digit-only form as a directory name.

---

## 4. `/data/compliance/` — Government Filings

Stores the actual submission files (XML, PDF) generated for government platforms. The filing *record* lives in `/data/clients/{AFM}/compliance/filings.json` — this directory holds the *file artefacts* themselves.

```
/data/compliance/
╔══ vat/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY}{MM}_vat_return.xml      # VAT return XML for TAXIS
╔══ mydata/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY}{MM}_{invoice-number}_mydata.xml
╔══ efka/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY}{MM}_efka_declaration.xml
╔══ e1/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY}_e1_form.xml             # Individual tax returns
╔══ e3/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY}_e3_form.xml             # Business activity statements
╔══ corporate-tax/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY}_corporate_tax.xml
└══ submissions/
    └══ {AFM}_{YYYY}{MM}_{type}_submission-receipt.json   # Government confirmation receipts
```

**Naming convention:** `{AFM}_{period}_{type}.{ext}` — always lowercase type, always ISO period format (YYYYMM or YYYY), always the full AFM with EL prefix.

---

## 5. `/data/banking/` — Bank Statement Pipeline

```
/data/banking/
╔══ imports/
╚   ╔══ alpha/         # Alpha Bank raw statement files
╚   ╔══ nbg/           # National Bank of Greece
╚   ╔══ eurobank/      # Eurobank
╚   ╔══ piraeus/       # Piraeus Bank
╚   └══ other/         # Other banks
╔══ processing/
╚   ╔══ raw/           # Imported, not yet validated
╚   ╔══ validated/     # Format validation complete
╚   ╔══ categorized/   # Transactions categorised
╚   └══ reconciled/    # Reconciliation complete
╔══ reconciliation/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY-MM}_reconciliation.json  # Per-client reconciliation reports
└══ exports/
    └══ {AFM}_{YYYY-MM}_transactions.csv     # Clean transaction exports
```

**Note:** `/data/alpha-bank/`, `/data/nbg-statements/`, `/data/eurobank/`, `/data/piraeus-bank/` used in earlier skill versions are **deprecated**. All bank imports go through `/data/banking/imports/{bank}/`.

---

## 6. `/data/ocr/` — OCR Processing Pipeline

```
/data/ocr/
╔══ incoming/
╚   ╔══ scanned/       # Flatbed scanner input
╚   ╔══ photos/        # Mobile phone photos of documents
╚   ╔══ government/    # Government-issued documents (AADE letters, etc.)
╚   └══ handwritten/   # Handwritten documents requiring special handling
╔══ preprocessing/
╚   └══ enhanced/      # Image-enhanced versions awaiting OCR
╔══ processing/
╚   ╔══ greek-ocr/     # Greek language OCR in progress
╚   ╔══ classification/ # Document type being determined
╚   └══ validation/    # OCR output being validated
╔══ output/
╚   ╔══ text-extracted/       # Raw text output from OCR
╚   ╔══ structured-data/      # Structured JSON extracted from text
╚   └══ searchable-pdf/       # PDFs with embedded text layer
└══ accounting-ready/          # Processed output ready for accounting-workflows skill
```

**Note:** `/data/scanned-documents/` used in earlier skill versions is **deprecated**. All scanned input goes to `/data/ocr/incoming/scanned/`.

---

## 7. `/data/efka/` — EFKA Processing Pipeline

```
/data/efka/
╔══ employees/
╚   ╔══ active/        # Current employee records
╚   ╔══ pending/       # New employees awaiting EFKA registration
╚   ╔══ terminated/    # Terminated employees (retained per legal requirements)

```

---

## 8. `/data/reports/` — Generated Reports

Human-readable reports. These are outputs, not inputs to other skills.

```
/data/reports/
╔══ daily/
╚   └══ {YYYY-MM-DD}_daily_summary.pdf
╔══ weekly/
╚   └══ {YYYY-WNN}_weekly_report.pdf

└══ financial-statements/
    └══ {AFM}_{YYYY-MM}_financial-pack_v{N}.pdf   # Client-facing PDF statement pack
```

**Note:** `/data/reports/monthly-expenses.json` (used in Skill 1) is deprecated. Expense data belongs in `/data/clients/{AFM}/compliance/` or exported via `/data/exports/`.

---

## 9. `/data/exports/` — Data Leaving the System

Files generated for external consumption (Excel exports, CSV downloads, accounting software imports).

```
/data/exports/
╔══ clients/
╚   └══ {YYYY-MM-DD}_client_export.{xlsx|csv|json}
╔══ transactions/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY-MM}_transactions.{csv|xlsx}
╔══ compliance/
╚   └══ {AFM}_{YYYY}_compliance_summary.xlsx
└══ accounting-software/
    └══ {AFM}_{YYYY-MM}_{target-system}.{qbx|csv|xlsx}
```

---

## 10. `/data/imports/` — Bulk Data Entering the System

Structured bulk imports (spreadsheets of client lists, employee rosters, etc.) — not raw documents (those go to `/data/incoming/`).

```
/data/imports/
╔══ clients/           # Bulk client onboarding files
╔══ employees/         # Bulk employee roster imports
└══ historical/        # Historical data migration files
```

---

## 11. `/data/dashboard/` — Dashboard State

```
/data/dashboard/
╔══ config/
╚   ╔══ firm-settings.yaml
╚   ╔══ alert-rules.yaml
╚   ╔══ report-templates.yaml
╚   └══ user-preferences/{username}.yaml

## 12. `/data/auth/` — Authentication & Access Control

```
/data/auth/
╔══ users/
╚   └══ {username}/
╚       ╔══ profile.json
╚       ╔══ credentials.json     # Hashed — never plaintext

## 13. `/data/backups/` — Encrypted Backups

```
/data/backups/
╔══ full_{YYYYMMDD}.tar.enc                        # Full system backup (weekly)
╔══ incremental_{YYYYMMDD}.tar.enc                 # Incremental backup (daily)
╔══ clients_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}.json.enc           # Client snapshot (event-driven)
╔══ compliance_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}.json.enc        # Compliance snapshot (post-submission)
╔══ auth_{YYYYMMDD}.json.enc                       # Auth data backup
╔══ restore-test/                                  # Ephemeral — restore verification workspace
└══ archives/                                      # Long-term retention archives (post-active)
```

**Naming convention:** Always include date and time in backup filename. Always `.enc` extension for encrypted files. Encryption keys are stored outside `/data/` — never adjacent to backup files.

---

## 14. `/data/gdpr-exports/` — GDPR Subject Access Exports

```
/data/gdpr-exports/
└══ {AFM}_gdpr_export_{YYYYMMDD}.json
```

---

## 15. `/data/system/` — System Files

```
/data/system/
╔══ skill-versions.json          # Installed skill versions and checksums
╔══ migration-log.json           # Schema migration history

## 16. `/data/memory/` — Agent Memory & Feedback

The agent's episodic memory, failure capture, pattern learning store, GitHub proposal queue, and rate-limit state. Written to by all skills (episode and failure hooks) and managed by the `memory-feedback` skill (Skill 19). No skill other than `memory-feedback` reads from this tree for decision-making — it is strictly write-on-event, read-by-Skill-19.

```
/data/memory/
╔══ episodes/
╚   └══ {YYYY-MM-DD}/
╚       └══ {session-id}_{action-type}.json    # Successful/completed agent actions
╔══ failures/
╚   └══ {YYYY-MM-DD}/
╚       └══ {session-id}_{failure-type}.json   # Failures with structured reflection
╔══ patterns/
╚   ╔══ successes/
╚   ╚   └══ {pattern-id}.json                  # Recurring good outcomes extracted from episodes
╚   └══ failures/
╚       └══ {pattern-id}.json                  # Recurring problems extracted from failures
╔══ corrections/
╚   └══ {YYYY-MM-DD}_{correction-id}.json      # Human corrections to agent behaviour
╔══ proposals/
╚   └══ {YYYY-MM-DD}_{skill-name}_{id}.md      # Draft skill improvements awaiting GitHub PR
└══ rate-limits/
    ╔══ current-state.json                      # Live token and storage consumption
    ╔══ daily-log.json                          # Per-day consumption history
    └══ config.json                             # Configurable limits (hard floors enforced)
```

**Episode logging trigger:** Any agent action that makes a decision, produces output, or interacts with a government system. Trivial reads are not logged.

**Failure logging trigger:** Any error, intent misread, missing data condition, or human correction. Always includes `what_should_have_happened` field.

**Pattern scan schedule:** Once daily at 02:00 Athens time. Never during business hours. Maximum 3 proposals per day. Maximum 2 GitHub PRs per day.

**Storage limits (defaults):**
- Episodes: 500 MB max — auto-archive after 90 days
- Failures: 200 MB max
- Patterns: 50 MB max
- Proposals: 50 MB max
- Total `/data/memory/`: 2 GB hard ceiling — system halts memory writes at 90% capacity

**GitHub integration:** When a failure pattern reaches confidence threshold (≥0.85, ≥3 occurrences), `memory-feedback` creates a branch on GitHub and opens a pull request against the relevant SKILL.md file. Human must review and merge. Agent never pushes directly to main. Rejected PRs are logged — the same change is never re-proposed.

**Rate limit tokens:** Memory and reflection operations are budgeted separately from accounting operations. Default: 5,000 tokens/day for all memory processes combined.

| Period references | `YYYY-MM` | `2026-01` | Monthly periods |
| ISO timestamps (JSON) | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` | `2026-02-18T14:30:00Z` | Always UTC in storage |
| Display to users | `DD/MM/YYYY` | `18/02/2026` | Greek date format |
| CLI arguments `--date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2026-02-18` | ISO for CLI args |
| CLI arguments `--period` | `YYYY-MM` | `2026-01` | |

### Currency

| JSON storage | Numeric, 2dp | `12500.00` | Never include € symbol in stored values |
| File names | No currency | `12500` | Integer amounts only in filenames |
| Display to users | `€XX,XXX.XX` | `€12,500.00` | Standard EU format |
| CLI output | `EUR XX,XXX.XX` | `EUR 12,500.00` | ASCII-safe for terminal |

### File Naming Pattern

**Pattern:** `{AFM}_{YYYY-MM}_{type}_{optional-detail}.{ext}`

Examples:
- `EL123456789_2026-01_vat_return.xml`
- `EL123456789_2026-02_reconciliation_report.pdf`
- `EL123456789_2025_e1_form.xml`
- `EL123456789_2026-02_payslip_nikos-papadopoulos.pdf`

**Rules:**
- Lowercase type and detail segments
- Hyphens within segments (not underscores)
- Underscores between segments
- No spaces anywhere in file names
- No Greek characters in file names — use Latin transliteration for employee names
- No special characters except hyphens and underscores

### Employee Name Slugs (for file names)

Greek names in file names must be transliterated to ASCII lowercase with hyphens:
- `Îίκος Παπαδόπουλος` → `nikos-papadopoulos`
- `ΜαÏία Κωνσταντίνου` → `maria-konstantinou`
- `ΔήμητÏα ΚαλαμαÏά` → `dimitra-kalamara`

## Enforcement Rules for All Skills

1. **Never introduce a new top-level directory** under `/data/` without updating this document first.
2. **Never write processed/canonical data to `/data/processing/`** — it is temporary only.
3. **Never write client data outside `/data/clients/{AFM}/`** — client-data-management is the only writer.
4. **Always use the full AFM with EL prefix** in all paths, filenames, and JSON keys.
5. **Always use ISO date format** (`YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYYMMDD`) in file names and JSON — never `DD/MM/YYYY` in stored data.
6. **Never use Greek characters in file names or directory names** — only in JSON values and display output.
7. **Currency values in JSON are always numeric** — never strings with € symbols.
8. **All timestamps in JSON are UTC** — display conversion to `Europe/Athens` happens at the output layer only.
9. **The `/data/processing/` tree is ephemeral** — never reference it as the source of truth from another skill.
10. **Deprecated paths are read-only legacy** — redirect to canonical paths, never create new files at deprecated locations.

## Unified Audit Event Schema

Every skill must log significant actions using this single JSON schema. Audit events are written to `/data/system/logs/audit/` and are the authoritative record for regulatory inspection.

```json
{
  "event_id": "EVT-20260219-143022-a7b3",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-19T14:30:22Z",
  "skill": "greek-compliance-aade",
  "action": "vat_return_submitted",
  "category": "government_submission",
  "user": {
    "username": "m.papadopoulou",
    "role": "senior_accountant",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.42"
  },
  "client": {
    "afm": "EL123456789",
    "name": "ALPHA TRADING AE"
  },
  "details": {
    "period": "2026-01",
    "filing_type": "F2_VAT_RETURN",
    "amount": 3340.00,
    "submission_ref": "AADE-2026-0142"
  },
  "before_state": null,
  "after_state": "submitted",
  "approval": {
    "prepared_by": "a.nikolaou",
    "approved_by": "m.papadopoulou",
    "approved_at": "2026-02-19T14:28:00Z"
  },
  "data_classification": "confidential",
  "result": "success"
}
```

**Required fields for all events:** `event_id`, `timestamp`, `skill`, `action`, `category`, `user.username`, `user.role`, `result`.

**Optional fields:** `client`, `details`, `before_state`, `after_state`, `approval`, `data_classification`.

**Event categories:**
- `government_submission` — any filing sent to AADE, EFKA, myDATA
- `data_modification` — create, update, or delete of client records
- `access_event` — login, logout, session activity, access denial
- `document_processing` — OCR, classification, extraction, validation
- `financial_output` — statement generation, amendment, report creation
- `communication` — client correspondence sent
- `system_operation` — backup, integrity check, schema migration
- `security_event` — lockout, 2FA failure, session revocation, permission change

**Storage:** `/data/system/logs/audit/{YYYY-MM-DD}_audit.jsonl` (one JSON object per line, append-only).

**Retention:** Audit logs are retained for 10 years per Greek tax law and EU regulatory requirements.

## Encryption-at-Rest Specification

Directories containing sensitive data must be encrypted at rest in production deployments. This is required for GDPR compliance (EU Regulation 2016/679, implemented in Greece by Law 4624/2019).

### Directories Requiring Encryption

| Directory | Classification | Encryption Required | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/data/auth/` | Restricted | **Mandatory** | Credential hashes, session data, 2FA secrets |
| `/data/clients/` | Confidential | **Mandatory** | Financial records, PII (names, AFMs, IBANs) |
| `/data/compliance/` | Confidential | **Mandatory** | Tax filings containing financial data |
| `/data/efka/` | Confidential | **Mandatory** | Employee PII, salary data, social security numbers |
| `/data/banking/` | Confidential | **Recommended** | Bank statements, account numbers |
| `/data/backups/` | Confidential | **Already encrypted** | AES-256 via Skill 17 |
| `/data/gdpr-exports/` | Confidential | **Mandatory** | Subject access request data |
| `/data/processing/` | Internal | Optional | Ephemeral — deleted after pipeline |
| `/data/reports/` | Internal | Recommended | May contain client financial summaries |
| `/data/system/` | Internal | Optional | Logs and operational data |

### Implementation

```yaml
Encryption_At_Rest:
  method: "AES-256-GCM"
  key_management:
    master_key_source: "Environment variable OPENCLAW_ENCRYPTION_KEY or hardware security module"
    key_rotation: "Annual, or immediately on suspected compromise"
    never: "Never store the master key inside /data/ or in any SKILL.md file"
    
  options:
    full_disk: "Preferred — use LUKS/dm-crypt on the volume hosting /data/"
    directory_level: "Alternative — use fscrypt or gocryptfs per directory"
    file_level: "Minimum — encrypt individual JSON files with per-file keys derived from master"
    
  verification:
    command: "openclaw integrity verify-encryption --check-all-sensitive-dirs"
    schedule: "Weekly, as part of system integrity check"
```

### Data Classification Labels

Every JSON record stored in encrypted directories should include a `data_classification` field:

```json
{
  "data_classification": "confidential"
}
```

Valid values: `public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `restricted`.

This field enables rapid scoping during GDPR breach notification (72-hour requirement) — you can quickly determine what classification of data was exposed.

## Professional Liability Disclaimer Template

Every client-facing document generated by the system must include this disclaimer. Skills that produce client-visible output (Skills 15, 16, 18) must append this to their output templates.

### Standard Disclaimer (Greek)

```

### Standard Disclaimer (English)

```
This document was prepared with the assistance of automated accounting software.
The information contained herein does not constitute professional accounting or
tax advice. Review by a licensed accountant is recommended before making any

```

### Usage Rules

- **Financial statements** (Skill 15): Include both Greek and English disclaimers in PDF footer
- **Client correspondence** (Skill 16): Include Greek disclaimer in email footer
- **Advisory reports** (Skill 18): Include English disclaimer in internal reports, Greek in client-facing
- **Government submissions**: Disclaimer is NOT included in filings sent to AADE/EFKA (these are formal submissions, not advisory documents)

## Input Validation Rules

All skills must validate incoming data against these rules before processing. Invalid input must be rejected with a clear error message — never silently accepted.

### Identifier Validation

```yaml
Validation_Rules:
  afm:
    format: "EL followed by exactly 9 digits"
    regex: "^EL[0-9]{9}$"
    examples_valid: ["EL123456789", "EL000000001"]
    examples_invalid: ["123456789", "EL12345", "el123456789", "GR123456789"]
    
  iban:
    format: "GR followed by 25 alphanumeric characters"
    regex: "^GR[0-9]{25}$"
    note: "Validate check digits per ISO 13616"
    
  ama:
    description: "EFKA registration number"
    format: "Numeric, variable length up to 12 digits"
    regex: "^[0-9]{1,12}$"
    
  amka:
    description: "Social security number"
    format: "Exactly 11 digits (DDMMYY + 5 sequence digits)"
    regex: "^[0-9]{11}$"
```

### Financial Value Validation

```yaml
Financial_Validation:
  currency_amounts:
    type: "numeric (float or decimal)"
    precision: "2 decimal places"
    never: "Never store as string with euro symbol"
    range: "0.00 to 999,999,999.99 for normal operations"
    negative: "Allowed for credit notes and adjustments — flag if unexpected"
    
  vat_rates:
    valid_values: [0.24, 0.13, 0.06, 0.0]
    labels: ["24% standard", "13% reduced", "6% super-reduced", "0% exempt"]
    note: "Reject any other rate — may indicate data entry error"
    
  periods:
    monthly: "YYYY-MM format, e.g. 2026-01"
    annual: "YYYY format, e.g. 2025"
    regex_monthly: "^[0-9]{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])$"
    regex_annual: "^[0-9]{4}$"
```

### Date and Time Validation

```yaml
Date_Validation:
  stored_format: "ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD for dates, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ for timestamps"
  display_format: "DD/MM/YYYY for Greek client output, YYYY-MM-DD for internal"
  timezone: "All stored timestamps in UTC. Convert to Europe/Athens only at display layer."
  never: "Never store DD/MM/YYYY in JSON — only in display templates"
  
  fiscal_year:
    default: "Calendar year (January 1 — December 31)"
    alternative: "Some entities use non-calendar fiscal years — check client profile"
```

### String Validation

```yaml
String_Validation:
  client_names:
    charset: "Greek Unicode (U+0370-U+03FF) and Latin characters, spaces, hyphens, periods"
    max_length: 200
    note: "Store in original case — never force uppercase in storage (uppercase for display only)"
    
  file_names:
    charset: "Latin alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, periods only"
    never: "Never use Greek characters, spaces, or special characters in file names"
    max_length: 255
    
  descriptions:
    charset: "Any UTF-8"
    max_length: 2000
```
