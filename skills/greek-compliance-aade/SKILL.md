# Greek Compliance & AADE Integration

This skill transforms OpenClaw into a Greek accounting compliance specialist, handling AADE submissions, VAT calculations, payroll processing, social security contributions, and regulatory deadlines specific to Greek business operations.


## Setup

```bash
# 1. Set data directory
export OPENCLAW_DATA_DIR="/data"

# 2. AADE credentials (required only for submitting filings — preparation works offline)
export AADE_USERNAME="your-aade-username"
export AADE_PASSWORD="your-aade-password"

# 3. Ensure dependencies
which jq curl || sudo apt install jq curl

# 4. Create compliance directories
mkdir -p $OPENCLAW_DATA_DIR/compliance/{vat,efka,mydata,e1,e3}
```

**Security notes:**
- AADE credentials are only used when submitting filings to the government portal

### Four-Eyes Approval Workflow for Government Submissions

All filings to AADE, EFKA, and myDATA require two-person approval before submission. This protects against accidental filings and provides professional liability coverage.

```yaml
Four_Eyes_Workflow:
  step_1_prepare:
    role: "accountant"
    action: "Prepare the filing (VAT return, EFKA declaration, myDATA submission)"
    command: "openclaw greek vat-return --client EL123456789 --period 2026-01 --prepare"
    output: "Draft filing saved to /data/processing/compliance/ with status: prepared"
    
  step_2_review:
    role: "senior_accountant"
    action: "Review the prepared filing — verify figures, check for anomalies"
    command: "openclaw greek review-filing --afm EL123456789 --period 2026-01 --type vat"
    output: "Filing displayed with summary, comparison to prior period, and anomaly flags"
    
  step_3_approve:
    role: "senior_accountant"
    action: "Explicitly approve the filing for submission"
    command: "openclaw greek approve-filing --afm EL123456789 --period 2026-01 --type vat --approved-by m.papadopoulou"
    output: "Filing status changed to: approved. Approval logged to audit trail."
    
  step_4_submit:
    role: "senior_accountant"
    action: "Submit the approved filing to the government system"
    command: "openclaw greek submit-filing --afm EL123456789 --period 2026-01 --type vat"
    gate: "System verifies filing has approval record before allowing submission"
    output: "Filing submitted. Confirmation receipt stored. Status: submitted."
    
  enforcement:
    - "A filing with status 'prepared' cannot be submitted — it must be 'approved' first"
    - "The preparer and approver must be different users"
    - "Both preparer and approver are recorded in the audit event"
    - "Emergency override requires admin role and logs a security event"
    
  audit_record:
    prepared_by: "username of accountant who prepared the filing"
    prepared_at: "timestamp of preparation"
    approved_by: "username of senior_accountant who approved"
    approved_at: "timestamp of approval"
    submitted_by: "username of person who triggered submission"
    submitted_at: "timestamp of submission"
    submission_ref: "AADE/EFKA confirmation reference"
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Monthly VAT Processing
```markdown
Command: openclaw compliance vat-return --client EL987654321 --period 2026-02 --prepare
System Response:
1. Loads all February invoices and receipts from /data/clients/EL987654321/documents/
2. Applies correct VAT rates (24%, 13%, 6%) based on transaction type and KAD
3. Calculates VAT position: EUR15,250 collected, EUR3,480 paid = EUR11,770 net due
4. Generates TAXIS XML at /data/compliance/vat/EL987654321_202602_vat_return.xml
5. Validates XML against current AADE schema before submission
Output: "February VAT return prepared. Net VAT due: EUR11,770. Payment due: March 20, 2026."
Next step: openclaw compliance vat-return --client EL987654321 --period 2026-02 --submit
```

### Example 2: Employee Payroll Processing
```markdown
Command: openclaw compliance payroll --client EL987654321 --employee "Maria Konstantinou" --period 2026-02 --hours-file /data/incoming/hours/maria_feb2026.csv
System Response:
1. Loads hours data: 168 regular + 8 Sunday overtime + 8 public holiday (Clean Monday)
2. Calculates gross pay: EUR15/hr x 168 + EUR18.75/hr x 8 + EUR30/hr x 8 = EUR2,910.00
3. Applies EFKA deductions: EUR431.58 (employee portion across all categories)
4. Calculates income tax withholding: EUR402.30
5. Writes payslip to /data/clients/EL987654321/payroll/2026-02/maria_konstantinou_payslip.pdf
6. Prepares EFKA declaration file for submission
Output: "Payslip generated. Net pay: EUR2,076.12. EFKA declaration ready for submission."
Next step: openclaw efka submit-declaration --client EL987654321 --period 2026-02
```

### Example 3: Real-time Invoice Submission to myDATA
```markdown
Command: openclaw compliance mydata-submit --client EL987654321 --invoice /data/ocr/output/accounting-ready/inv_2026_456.pdf
System Response:
1. Extracts required myDATA fields from invoice (vendor, customer, amounts, VAT, dates)
2. Identifies EU client -- applies reverse charge VAT (0% output, note added)
3. Generates myDATA XML with required structure
4. Submits to AADE myDATA API at mydatapi.aade.gr
5. Receives and stores confirmation receipt
6. Logs submission to /data/clients/EL987654321/compliance/filings.json
Output: "Invoice #2026-456 submitted to myDATA. Confirmation: AAD-2026-ABC123456789."
```
