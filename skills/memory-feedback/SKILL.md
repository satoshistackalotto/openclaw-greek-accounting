name: memory-feedback
description: Agent episodic memory, failure capture, pattern learning, and GitHub-based skill improvement for the OpenClaw Greek Accounting system. Logs every meaningful agent action and failure across all 18 skills. Runs nightly pattern scans to detect recurring problems and successes. Proposes skill improvements as GitHub pull requests for human review. Enforces token and storage rate limits to prevent runaway consumption. Semi-automatic: agent writes memory files freely, skill file changes require human approval via GitHub PR merge. Owner of /data/memory/. Designed for Phase 4 deployment after Phase 3B is stable and has generated meaningful learning data.

# Memory and Feedback

This skill gives the OpenClaw system a learning loop. All 18 skills log their episodes and failures. This skill reads those logs, detects patterns, and proposes improvements — as GitHub pull requests against the SKILL.md files that govern behaviour. Humans review and merge. The system learns.

This is Phase 4 infrastructure, designed to be activated once Phase 3B has been running long enough to generate meaningful data — typically 2-3 months of real operation. The episode and failure hooks in Skills 14-18 write to `/data/memory/` from day one. When this skill is activated, months of learning data are already waiting.

## Core Philosophy

- **Semi-Automatic by Design**: The agent owns its memory files — episodes and failures are written without approval. Skill files govern behaviour and require human review before any change takes effect. This boundary is non-negotiable
- **Pattern Detection, Not Gut Feel**: Improvements are proposed only when a pattern appears with sufficient frequency and confidence. A single failure is a data point. Three failures of the same type with the same trigger is a pattern
- **Human in the Loop for Skill Changes**: Every proposed skill improvement becomes a GitHub pull request. The accountant or developer sees exactly what changed, why, and what evidence led to the proposal. Merge = accepted. Close = rejected and never re-proposed
- **Rate Limited to Protect the Machine**: Memory operations are token-budgeted. Pattern scans run overnight. Storage limits are enforced. The system cannot consume itself
- **Honest About What It Does Not Know**: Patterns below the confidence threshold are stored but not proposed. The system does not act on weak evidence

```bash
# Log a successful episode (called internally by all skills)
openclaw memory log-episode --skill greek-financial-statements --type statement_generated --afm EL123456789 --period 2026-01 --session S20260218-001 --tokens 1240 --duration-seconds 31

## Pattern Detection

### Detection Algorithm

```yaml
Pattern_Detection:
  runs: "Nightly at 02:00 Athens time"
  lookback_window: "30 days rolling"
  minimum_occurrences: 3
  confidence_threshold_for_proposal: 0.85

  grouping_keys:
    - skill + failure_type                     # Same skill, same failure type
    - user_query_intent + agent_action_taken   # Same intent, same wrong action
    - skill + missing_data_source              # Same skill, same upstream data missing

  confidence_calculation:
    factors:
      - occurrence_count (weight: 40%)
      - recency_bias (more recent = higher weight) (weight: 30%)
      - human_correction_present (weight: 20%)
      - consistent_what_should_have_happened across occurrences (weight: 10%)

  output:
    above_threshold: "Write pattern to /data/memory/patterns/failures/{id}.json — eligible for proposal"
    below_threshold: "Write pattern to /data/memory/patterns/failures/{id}.json — marked WATCH, not proposable yet"

## Activation Checklist

Skill 19 should be activated when:

```yaml
Activation_Prerequisites:
  data_maturity:
    - "Phase 3B has been running for minimum 60 days"
    - "At least 100 episodes logged across all skills"
    - "At least 20 failures logged with what_should_have_happened populated"
    - "At least 3 human corrections on record"

  infrastructure:
    - "GitHub repo URL and token configured"
    - "Agent has branch creation access (not merge)"
    - "/data/memory/ directories exist and are writable"
    - "Storage monitoring confirms adequate space (min 5 GB free)"

  team_readiness:
    - "Senior accountant / developer briefed on PR review process"
    - "GitHub notifications configured for the memory/skill-improvement/* branch pattern"
    - "Team understands: close PR = rejected, merge PR = accepted change goes live"

  first_run:
    - "Run openclaw memory scan-patterns --since 60-days --dry-run first"
    - "Review all patterns detected before enabling live proposal creation"
    - "Confirm rate limit config matches team preferences"
    - "Enable with: openclaw memory activate --confirm"
```

---

## Integration Points

```yaml
Written_By_All_Skills:
  hook: "Every skill calls openclaw memory log-episode or openclaw memory log-failure as final step"
  episode_triggers: "Decision made, output produced, government system interaction"
  failure_triggers: "Any error, intent misread, missing data, human correction"

Read_By_Memory_Feedback_Only:
  note: "No other skill reads from /data/memory/ for decision-making"
  reason: "Memory data is raw and unverified until pattern-processed. Direct reads would propagate noise."

Downstream_Of_Memory_System:
  github: "Proposed skill improvements as pull requests"
  dashboard: "Memory health metrics (token usage, storage, pattern counts)"
  reports: "/data/reports/system/ — monthly memory activity report"
```

---

## Success Metrics

A successful deployment of this skill should achieve:
- ✅ 100% of qualifying agent actions generate an episode log within 5 seconds
- ✅ 100% of failures generate a failure log with what_should_have_happened populated
- ✅ Nightly pattern scan completes within the daily token budget
- ✅ At least one high-confidence pattern detected per month after 90 days of operation
- ✅ PRs opened for all proposals above the confidence threshold — zero silently dropped
- ✅ Rejected patterns never re-proposed — the rejection is respected
- ✅ Storage consumption stays within configured limits — no unchecked growth
- ✅ Zero PR merges without human action — agent never self-merges

Remember: This skill is how the system gets better over time without requiring manual review of every interaction. The value compounds. Month 3 of operation is more valuable than month 1. The team should expect to see the quality of the conversational assistant and financial statement generation improve measurably within 6 months of activation.
